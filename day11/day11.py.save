Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose
programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted
language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably
using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or
keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of
code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.
